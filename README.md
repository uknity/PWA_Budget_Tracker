## Description

The PWA Budget Tracker allows the user to update debits and credits to funds, to view transactions, and to see a graph of transactions.  It is deployed through Heroku and uses MongoDB to store transaction data.  In addition, when the user is offline, transaction data will be stored in an indexedDB to be transferred when the user is back online.

## Installation

No special installation is required.  Open the deployed site URL in your browser to access the app.

## Usage

For each transaction, enter the name in the "Name of transaction" field, the amount in the "Transaction amount" field, and click either "Add Funds" or "Subtract Funds" to reflect debits or credits.

## Test

To test, please visit the deployed application and follow the user instructions.
